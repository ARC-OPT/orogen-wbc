# Behaviour at the position limits (only reflexxes TypeIV!!!). Can be one of the following:
#   - POSITIONAL_LIMITS_IGNORE: Positional limits are completely ignored
#   - POSITIONAL_LIMITS_ERROR_MSG_ONLY: Component will go into error state if target is out of bounds
#   - POSITIONAL_LIMITS_ACTIVELY_PREVENT: Reflexxes will provide a smooth transition at the bounds and avoid exceeding them
# See reflexxes/RMLFlags.h for further details.
positional_limits_behavior: :POSITIONAL_LIMITS_IGNORE
# Synchronization behavior between different elements. Can be one of PHASE_SYNCHRONIZATION_IF_POSSIBLE, ONLY_TIME_SYNCHRONIZATION,
# ONLY_PHASE_SYNCHRONIZATION and NO_SYNCHRONIZATION. See reflexxes/RMLFlags.h for details.
synchronization_behavior: :PHASE_SYNCHRONIZATION_IF_POSSIBLE
